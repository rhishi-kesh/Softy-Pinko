<h2>Project Name: Softy-Pinko</h2>
<p>The project is done to master the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Jquery by watching YouTube videos.</p>
<p>I did not know the use of GIT and GitHub when I did the project. Long after the project was over I learned about GIT and GitHub and pushed the project to GitHub.</p>
